This project is a combination of machine learning and web app development.

- A project to create a digit recognition web application using Streamlit

- Developed a pipeline to train and validate a model on the MNIST Handwritten dataset.

- Fine-tuned the model until having a model that could confidently make inferences.

- Constructed an intuitive and user-friendly web interface using the Streamlit Python library.

A robust web app where users can draw a digit and the application, using the trained model, outputs the probabilities of what the drawn digit might be.
