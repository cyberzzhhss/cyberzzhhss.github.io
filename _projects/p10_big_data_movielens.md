Recommendation systems has been all around us. When we watch movies, listen to music, or order takeouts, we are all exposing our personal information, which allows com- panies to analyze our preferences and recommend items alike for better promotion and user engagement. In this project we aim at building a recommendation system with the MovieLens dataset using various models, including pop- ularity baseline model and latent factor model using Sparkâ€™s alternating least squares (ALS) method, and try to find the best hyper-parameters for best recommendation.
