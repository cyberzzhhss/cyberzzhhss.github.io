<meta name="description" content="Growing up in the East, I have never understood the fascination that westerners have about Santa Claus. But I do know that it is culturally inappropriate to tell kids that Santa Claus doesn’t exist. Let us therefore indulge a thought experiment. Let us say a 5 year old kid, Kevin, who believes Santa Claus is real. No one has ever told him that it is not real because no one wants to break the cultural norm. Therefore, if you ask Kevin, if Santa Claus is real, he will tell you in a heartbeat that it is real. Even if you use a polygraph to test him, it is still very much real, and polygraph won’t detect any anormaly; however, both you and me know very well that it is not the case.  My question then goes, is there anything in our life that we believe wholeheartedly is true but it ain’t so? If your haters tell you that you suck, do you really suck? Maybe it is another Santa Truth. It is lying without guilt. It is a subtle form of lying. Usually, people lie with full knowledge that their words do not match the objective reality. Sometimes, people unwittingly lie to each other due to ignorance. Therefore, it is very important to ascertain the words. Do not let negative thoughts sway you even you believe they are true. It might just be one of the Santa Truths.">
