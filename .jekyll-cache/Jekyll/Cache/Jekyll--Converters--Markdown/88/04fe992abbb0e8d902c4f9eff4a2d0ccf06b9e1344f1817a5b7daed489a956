<p>In thie project, we worked with more than 100GB+ 3-month millisecond-level high-frequency NYSE trades and quotes tick data of more than 1000 tickers to calibrate the Almgren market impact model by applying nonlinear regression.</p>

<p>We also formulated the Almgren-Chriss optimal execution problem as a stochastic control problem and derived the Hamiltonâ€“Jacobiâ€“Bellman equation and solved for the control and value function.</p>
